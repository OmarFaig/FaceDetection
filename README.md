With the help of the OpenCV library, a simple "Face Detection" application can be implemented. In the following files, you can detect faces either from a photo or using a laptop's webcam. To run the programs, you first need to install OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python` in cmd). During programming, all input photos or frames from the webcam are converted to grayscale because, for the algorithm implemented in OpenCV, colors are irrelevant. It differentiates and recognizes faces based on brightness levels.
